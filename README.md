# A STAR Algorithm Explaining How Google Maps Functions

This repository contains code that explains how the A* algorithm works and how it is used in Google Maps. The code generates a map of Connaught Place in New Delhi using the folium library. The map includes markers for Parliament of India and Modern School, as well as a line connecting the two locations.
